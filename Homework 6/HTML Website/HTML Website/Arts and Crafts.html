<p> 
    Creation is a fickle thing <br>
A mind stuffed with newness cannot comprehend the strange horizons it has entered <br>
With time the world fizzles into view, an understanding which builds upon itself<br>
Yet it will never happen again, not in the same form<br>
The aspect of developing consciousness is idiosyncratic, hard to pin down in a concise manner.<br>
</p>
<p>Creation. Such a fickle thing <br>
Nearly esoteric in nature <br>
An abstract impression on the individual <br>
Spiraling strands of thoughts are hard to grasp and harder to express <br>
In a sense, <br>
we are all gods creating our own visions of the world, <br>
A unique perception upon reality that no one else can harbor in thier hearts <br>
</p>
<p>If creation is a fickle thing, <br>
Unknowable and untouchable <br>
Divided from convention and collective purpose <br>
Difficult to explain wholly. <br>
Then why shouldn't I make this reality my own? <br>
Find connection in the simplicity of life <br>
Partake in pleasures barred from me by my upbringing <br>
Explore the possibility of change and self expression <br>
Without the constraints of holiness <br>
The strangler fig that wrapped around my throat and barred me from a lived life. <br>
Creation is yours to hold. However fickle it may be.<br>
