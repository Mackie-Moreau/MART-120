            <li><a href="HW2.html">Artist Lab</a></li>
            A small coding homework assignment to create a small art project that made use of code.org's Artist Lab and gain a fundamental base for coding. <br>
            <li> <a href="HW3.html">Scratch Game</a></li>
            A simple Scratch game where you play as a space cowpoke and defeat an alien. This assignment further cemented coding basics. <br>
            <li> <a href="HW4.html">Play Lab and Mobile Game</a></li>
            The Play lab game is a simple collection game where you aim to collect enough sandwiches to power your spaceship. The Mobile App is a choose your own adventure where you must find a sandwich for the InstaGator. This assignment allowed me to learn more coding basics. <br> 
            <li> <a href="HW5.html">Alice Game</a></li>
            A fairly rudimentary coded story/game in a program called Alice, involving an elk, a lost otter, and an anti-responsibilties crow. This assignment was stepping into writing my own code rather than using blocks. <br>
            <li>Website</li>
            What you're looking at now! The three other pages were made over the course of 3 weeks involving html and css languages. This was the first time I wrote code from scratch with some instruction. <br> 
            <li> <a href="HW10.html">Portrait</a></li>
            A web-based coding program using p5.js to create a portrait and learn the basics of the language. Again, writing code from scratch with a goal and some examples. 
            <li> <a href="HW13.html">Minigame</a></li>
            [FLASH WARNING] A web-based minigame involving moving a player character into a goal while obstacles move around you. This was a culmination of all of the previous coding knowledge I gained. <br>
